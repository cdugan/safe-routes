- Debug error that occurs on first route computation.
Error computing routes: Failed to execute 'json' on 'Response': Unexpected end of JSON input



- Reduce load times as much as possible
    - seems that maybe the graph does additional loading after HTTP request is made.
    We should include this loading in graph startup. No more lazy loading.
    - Seems that route computation is faster the second time. Again we should
    ensure that all loading is done at startup. 
- Make it more obvious that "Compare Routes" is actively running.



Add data from:
- Accident database - roads with higher density (accidents per daily traffic) of accidents are more dangerous. 
? Should we pair the curvature rating with a high speed rating?
