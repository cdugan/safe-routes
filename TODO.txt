- Add a boundary box around the loaded map to show what's in/out of bounds.
- If an inputted lat/long or address is outside the bounds, it should notify the user that it's 
    out of bounds and wait for another entry.
- if an address is entered, after pressing "Compare routes", it will be converted to latitude/longitude in the 
    text box. We should leave it as whatever form it was in originally.
- If address was entered, keep address in the search box
- Make fastest route more obvious with color - match stats to route color
- no scrolling if possible?
- what does safety score mean?
- safety score numbers are reversed
- end point different color from high risk
- Remove the slider, and instead just compute a fastest route, safest route, and balanced route (50% each.) 
- Remove the legend
- test with raleigh area

- layers option to see different safety data

- Address autocomplete?



Add data from:
- Accident database - roads with higher density (accidents per daily traffic) of accidents are more dangerous. 
? Should we pair the curvature rating with a high speed rating?
